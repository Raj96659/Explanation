N Queen =  no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

The time complexity of the N-Queens problem using backtracking is typically represented as O(N!),
where N is the number of queens and the size of the chessboard.

The space complexity of the N-Queens problem using backtracking depends on the data structures used to represent the chessboard .
The space complexity is O(N^2) to store the NÃ—N chessboard.

CODE EXPLANATION:

The print_solution function is responsible for printing the chessboard with queen placements. 

The is_safe function checks whether it's safe to place a queen at a specific position

The solve_n_queens function uses recursive backtracking to find valid queen placements

The n_queens function initializes an empty chessboard and begins the solving process by calling solve_n_queens
