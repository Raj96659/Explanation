Fibonacci - The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

Time Complexity: O(2^n) (because algorithm recalculates same fibonacci number multiple times)
Space Complexity: O(n) (due to the recursion call stack)

Recursion - Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem.

CODE EXPLANATION........

int fnum is a global variable used to count the number of steps

The fib_num function is a recursive function that takes an integer n as its argument
