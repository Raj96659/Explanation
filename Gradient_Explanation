Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize a function, particularly in machine learning and deep learning,


CODE EXPLANATION

x is initialized to 2, which is the starting point for the optimization.

lr (learning rate) is set to 0.01. The learning rate determines the step size for each iteration.

precision is set to 0.000001. It represents the threshold for stopping the optimization when the step size becomes smaller than this value.

previous_step_size is initialized to 1. This variable is used to track the step size in each iteration.

max_iter is set to 10000, which limits the number of iterations to prevent the loop from running indefinitely.

iters is initialized to 0 and is used as a counter to keep track of the number of iterations.

gf is a lambda function that defines the gradient (derivative) of the function you want to minimize. 
In this case, it's the gradient of (x + 3)^2.

The while loop runs as long as both the step size is greater than the precision and the number of iterations is less than max_iter.

Inside the loop:

prev stores the previous value of x.
x is updated using gradient descent: x = x - lr * gf(prev). 
This step is where the algorithm tries to find a better value for x to minimize the function.
previous_step_size is updated to the absolute difference between the new x and the previous x.
iters is incremented to keep track of the number of iterations.
The iteration number and the current value of x are printed.
