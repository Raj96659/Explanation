Imports necessary libraries and loads the Uber dataset from a CSV file named "uber.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame:

Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Datetime are imported.
The warnings are filtered to ignore them.
Converts the "pickup_datetime" column to the required datetime format.

Displays information about the DataFrame, including data types and non-null counts for each column.

Describes the statistical properties of the dataset using describe().

Checks for missing values in the DataFrame using isnull().sum() and drops rows with missing values using dropna().

Calculates the correlation between variables using corr().

Creates a boxplot for the "fare_amount" column to visualize its distribution.

Removes outliers from the "fare_amount" column by applying a filter based on quantiles.

Checks for missing values in the DataFrame again.

Prepares the data for modeling:

Separates the predictor variables x (excluding "fare_amount") and the target variable y.
Converts the "pickup_datetime" column to numeric format.
Selects only columns with names containing "Unnamed."
Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.

Applies linear regression and random forest regression models to the data and evaluates the performance of these models:

Creates a linear regression model (lrmodel) and fits it to the training data.
Makes predictions with the linear regression model.
Calculates the root mean squared error (RMSE) for the linear regression model.
Creates a random forest regression model (rfrmodel) with 100 estimators and fits it to the training data.
Makes predictions with the random forest regression model.
Calculates the RMSE for the random forest model.
