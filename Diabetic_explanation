pandas for data manipulation.
numpy for numerical operations.
sklearn.metrics for various classification metrics.
StandardScaler from scikit-learn for feature scaling.
train_test_split from scikit-learn for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
KNeighborsClassifier for creating and training the KNN classifier.
Loads a dataset from a CSV file named "diabetes.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame (df).

Displays the DataFrame to inspect its contents.

Checks the shape of the DataFrame using df.shape to get the number of rows and columns.

Checks for missing values in the DataFrame and counts the columns with missing values.

Extracts the features (input variables) from the DataFrame df_x by dropping the "Outcome" column, which is assumed to be the target variable. The target variable is stored in df_y.

Applies feature scaling using the StandardScaler to scale the feature values to have zero mean and unit variance. Feature scaling is often essential for KNN and other distance-based algorithms.

Splits the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split. 80% of the data is used for training (x_train and y_train), and 20% for testing (x_test and y_test).

Creates a KNN classifier with 7 neighbors and fits it to the training data.

Makes predictions on the test data using the trained KNN classifier.

Calculates and prints various classification metrics:

Confusion matrix (cs) using metrics.confusion_matrix.
Accuracy score (ac) using metrics.accuracy_score.
Error rate (er) as 1 minus the accuracy.
Precision (p) using metrics.precision_score.
Recall (r) using metrics.recall_score.
Classification report (cr) using metrics.classification_report, which provides a summary of several classification metrics.
This code provides a comprehensive analysis of the KNN classifier's performance, making it easier to evaluate the model's effectiveness for the diabetes dataset.
